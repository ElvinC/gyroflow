# Gyroflow - Video stabilization using gyroscope data targeting drone footage

## [Website with more info](http://gyroflow.xyz/)

A program built around Python, OpenCV, and PySide2 for video stabilization using gyroscope data.

The project consists of three core parts: A utility for the generation of lens undistortion preset, a utility for stabilizing footage using gyro data, and a utility for stretching 4:3 video to 16:9 using non-linear horizontal stretching (similar to GoPro's superview).

The main goal of creating something that can stabilize footage based on blackbox gyro data has mostly been achieved. Moving forwards, more work will be done to improve the quality of the result.

The launcher containing all the utilities is available by executing `gyroflow.py` if all the dependencies are met. Otherwise a binary can be found over in [releases](https://github.com/ElvinC/gyroflow/releases). Also, check out the wiki where there's some more information about the camera calibration and video stabilization process.

## Run using python and Poetry:
Note: Try the dev branch for the newest features.

* Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* Clone or download the files from this repo
* Navigate to the folder using a commandline and install dependencies using `poetry install`
* Run the application using `poetry run python gyroflow.py`

## General recording tips
* Use the settings that give the widest possible field of view (more data to work with). For a lot of cameras, this is in the 4:3 aspect ratio.
* If using the main drone flight controller for logging, the camera should be hardmounted.
* If using a secondary logger on the camera or internal camera logging, some soft mounting is preferred to isolate vibrations.
